function sensorArrayAnalyzer
%sensorArrayAnalyzer Analyze beam pattern of linear, planar, and conformal
%sensor arrays
%   sensorArrayAnalyzer is an interactive app for the analysis and
%   visualization of phased arrays. It allows the user to select an array
%   from a list, change its parameters and interact with several updated
%   plots, such as the array geometry, the array response pattern. The app
%   also calculates several array characteristics like array gain, array
%   span and the total number of elements.  The user can generate MATLAB
%   code which would create plots similar to the current app view.
