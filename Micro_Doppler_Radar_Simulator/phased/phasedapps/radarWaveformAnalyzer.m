function radarWaveformAnalyzer
%radarWaveformAnalyzer Analyze performance characteristics of pulsed,
%frequency modulated, and phase coded waveforms
%   radarWaveformAnalyzer is an interactive app for the analysis of radar
%   and sonar pulsed and continuous waveforms.  It allows the user to
%   select a waveform from a list, change its parameters and interact with
%   several updated plots, such as the magnitude and phase response, the
%   ambiguity function, spectrum and spectrogram.  The app also calculates
%   several waveform characteristics.  The user can generate MATLAB code
%   which would create plots similar to the current app view.
